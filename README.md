# Aguascalientes Transit Data Analysis

This project analyzes data from the Aguascalientes public transportation system, using the GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) dataset to explore usage patterns and optimize routes and schedules.

## Description

This project is designed to provide detailed analysis and recommendations on the efficiency of the public transportation system in Aguascalientes. It uses GTFS data to evaluate route coverage, frequencies, and schedule adherence, among other aspects.

## Project Structure

The project includes several Python scripts that are used to load, process and analyze the transportation data:

- `explore_data.py`: Performs an initial exploratory analysis of the loaded data.
- `analysis.py`: Contains more specific functions for detailed analysis, such as path optimization.

## Requirements

This project requires Python and several external libraries, including:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

Install the necessary dependencies with pip:

````bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
````

### Additional Notes:

- **Customization**: Make sure that script names and file paths are correctly reflected according to how you have organized them in your project.
- Data**: It is important to provide clear information on how and where to obtain the necessary GTFS data so that others can seamlessly replicate or extend your analysis.
- License**: Consider adding a license if you have not already done so, especially if you plan to make the project publicly accessible.
